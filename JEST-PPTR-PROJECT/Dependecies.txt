jest is used for unit testing

steps to create jest.config.js
after step 1 type following cmd on terminal

./node_modules/.bin/jest --init

after jest.config.js is created go to it ans set preset to "jest-puppeteer" and comment test-environment

create a file named jest-puppeteer.config.js in project's root folder and write following code

module.exports = {
    launch: {
        headless: false
    },
    browserContext: "incognito"
    
};

my code was giving error when i tried to override timeout jest.setTimeout(8000)
